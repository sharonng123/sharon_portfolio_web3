## 1. Delivery Status Flow

### 1.1 Entry Points
- **Primary**: "Track my order" / "Delivery status" / "Where is my order?"
- **Secondary**: Order number mention in conversation
- **Proactive**: System-triggered notifications for status updates

### 1.2 Authentication & Order Identification

- **Order Validation**: Verify order exists and belongs to authenticated user
- **Status Classification**: Categorize order status for appropriate response

### 1.3 Status Categories & Responses

#### Processing Status
- **Message**: "Your order #[ORDER_ID] is being prepared in our warehouse"
- **Additional Info**: Estimated dispatch time, items being processed
- **Actions**: Option to modify delivery address (if eligible)

#### Shipped Status
- **Message**: "Great news! Your order #[ORDER_ID] has been shipped"
- **Additional Info**: Tracking number, carrier details, estimated delivery
- **Actions**: Live tracking link, delivery preferences

#### Out for Delivery
- **Message**: "Your order is out for delivery and will arrive today"
- **Additional Info**: Delivery window, live tracking (if available)
- **Actions**: Delivery instructions, reschedule options

#### Delivered Status

---

## 2. Order Cancellation Flow

### 2.1 Eligibility Logic
```
Order Status Check → Time Window Validation → Item Restrictions → Final Eligibility
```

#### Cancellation Rules
- **Eligible**: Orders in "Processing" status within 2 hours of placement
- **Partially Eligible**: Multi-item orders where some items are still processing
- **Not Eligible**: Shipped orders, custom items, prescription products

### 2.2 Cancellation Process

#### Step 1: Order Selection
- Display recent orders (last 30 days)
- Allow manual order number entry
- Show order details for confirmation

#### Step 2: Eligibility Check
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for eligibility logic
if (orderStatus === "Processing" && 
    timeSinceOrder < 2hours && 
    !hasRestrictedItems(order)) {
    return "ELIGIBLE";
} else if (orderStatus === "Shipped") {
    return "NOT_ELIGIBLE_SHIPPED";
} else {
    return "NOT_ELIGIBLE_TIME";
}
```

#### Step 3: Cancellation Confirmation
- **Display**: Refund amount, processing time, confirmation details
- **Options**: Confirm cancellation, modify order instead, return to menu
- **Validation**: Final confirmation with order details

#### Step 4: Processing
- **System Action**: Update order status to "Cancelled"
- **Payment**: Initiate refund process
- **Notification**: Send confirmation email/SMS
- **Follow-up**: Provide refund tracking information

### 2.3 Error Handling
- **System Errors**: Graceful fallback to live agent
- **Partial Failures**: Clear explanation of what succeeded/failed
- **Timeout Issues**: Retry mechanism with user notification
