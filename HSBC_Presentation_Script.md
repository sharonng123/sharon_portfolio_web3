## Part 3: Addressing the Experience Gap (3-4 minutes)

### Why My Non-Banking Background is Actually an Advantage

#### 1. **Fresh Perspective on Legacy Problems**
- **"Banking UX often suffers from legacy thinking. My outsider perspective helps identify assumptions that insiders might miss."**
- **Example**: In crypto, I learned that users don't care about technical complexity - they want simple, secure experiences. Same applies to banking.

#### 2. **Cross-Industry Innovation**
- **Retail → Banking**: Loyalty programs, personalized recommendations, omnichannel experiences
- **Gaming → Banking**: Gamification for financial education, progress tracking for savings goals
- **Web3 → Banking**: Cutting-edge security UX, progressive disclosure for complex products

#### 3. **Rapid Learning & Adaptation**
- **Self-taught transition**: Social Science → Digital Marketing → UX Design → Web3
- **Crypto Journey (2022-2025)**: From NFT novice to designing wallet interfaces
- **Technical Skills**: Learned Figma, user research, information architecture independently

### My 90-Day Learning Plan for Banking UX
**"Here's how I'd quickly get up to speed:"**
1. **Week 1-2**: Shadow customer service, analyze current user feedback
2. **Week 3-4**: Conduct user interviews with different customer segments
3. **Week 5-8**: Deep dive into regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, GDPR, local banking laws)
